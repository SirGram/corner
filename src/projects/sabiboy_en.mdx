## Why Rust?

---

Well, I had heard of Rust for a while now and I wanted to give it a go. I saw some guy programming his own NES emulator in this language and I was like "Wow, that's cool!".
As it turns out, programming emulators and low level systems programming is a great application for Rust because of how it handles memory.

<br />
## The Emulation Journey 
---
 The main objective was to create a working emulator
for the original DMG Gameboy. Before diving in, I studied simpler systems like the
chip-8 to understand the fundamentals before tackling the more complex Gameboy architecture.

    "Implement a CPU that passes basic tests",
    "Create a memory system that connects to all components",
    "Develop the screen display functionality",
    "Build an input system",
    "Get basic games running",
    "Add advanced features (sound, timers, memory bank controllers)",
    "Port it to run in the browser",
    "Create an online library system"
  ]} />

It wasn't long before I found myself being stuck for many days trying to figure out some glitches, especially with the PPU.

## The Library

---

I wanted to build a server-side library that would allow me to easily access
the emulator from the browser.

For using the emulator in the browser, I used wasm-bindgen to compile the rust code into a wasm file.

Some of the features I ended up adding:

-A proper game library system where you can add and manage ROMs

-A savestate system that relies on MongoDB

-Customizable settings for the emulator like different color palettes or debug.

-Offline mode for uninvited users
