## Objective
---
<br />
This website was a practice for learning a bit of the traditional MERN stack. 
Nest is an opinionated framework based on Express.js that's super easy to set up.

With this project, I scaffolded a CRUD app that has several routes, different user permissions and uses guards to limit access to outside users.
