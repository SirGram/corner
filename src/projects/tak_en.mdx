## The game of Tak

---

<br />

Tak is a boardgame similar to chess with 2 players where you can move several pieces during a turn while trying to create bridges between sides.

During a turn, you select a stack of pieces you 'own' and move them in a direction while leaving at least one on each tile.

<br />
## Features

---

<br />
-Local and multiplayer 

-Message system 

-History of moves 

-Lobby and rooms

-Sound effects 

-2D board representation 

-Updates in real time

<br />

## Models and style

---

<br />
I used Blender for modelling the game pieces and board and creating some textures.

 For the UI, I went with my preferred Component Library ShadCN.

## Challenges

<br />

A board is normally represented as a 2D array. For transforming that representation into a 3D canvas, I wrote this function:

<br />
```typescript
  function transformPieces(pieces: Piece[], board: TBoard): Piece3DExtended[] {
        let whiteFlatstoneCount = 0;
        let blackFlatstoneCount = 0;
        let whiteCapstoneCount = 0;
        let blackCapstoneCount = 0;
        const stackHeights: { [key: string]: number } = {};

        return pieces.map((piece: Piece): Piece3DExtended => {
            const tile = board.find((t) => t.pieces.includes(piece.id));
            if (tile) {
                // If the piece is on the board
                const tileKey = `${tile.position.x},${tile.position.y}`;

                if (!stackHeights[tileKey]) {
                    stackHeights[tileKey] = 0;
                }

                const pieceIndex = tile.pieces.indexOf(piece.id);
                const pieceHeight = tile.pieces.slice(0, pieceIndex).reduce((height, pieceId) => {
                    const p = pieces.find((p) => p.id === pieceId);
                    return height + (p ? pieceHeights[p.type] : 0);
                }, 0);

                return {
                    ...piece,
                    position: [tile.position.x, pieceHeight, tile.position.y],
                    height: pieceHeights[piece.type],
                    model: getPieceModel(piece),
                };
            } else {
                // If the piece is not on the board, place it in a pile
                let position: Position3D;
                let height: number;

                if (piece.type === 'flatstone' || piece.type === 'standingstone') {
                    if (piece.color === 'white') {
                        const pileIndex = whiteFlatstoneCount % 3;
                        position = WHITE_PILES[pileIndex];
                        height = Math.floor(whiteFlatstoneCount / 3) * pieceHeights['flatstone'];
                        whiteFlatstoneCount++;
                    } else {
                        const pileIndex = blackFlatstoneCount % 3;
                        position = BLACK_PILES[pileIndex];
                        height = Math.floor(blackFlatstoneCount / 3) * pieceHeights['flatstone'];
                        blackFlatstoneCount++;
                    }
                } else {
                    // capstone
                    if (piece.color === 'white') {
                        position = WHITE_CAPSTONE_PILE;
                        height = whiteCapstoneCount * pieceHeights['capstone'];
                        whiteCapstoneCount++;
                    } else {
                        position = BLACK_CAPSTONE_PILE;
                        height = blackCapstoneCount * pieceHeights['capstone'];
                        blackCapstoneCount++;
                    }
                }

                return {
                    ...piece,
                    position: [position[0], position[1] + height, position[2]],
                    height: pieceHeights[piece.type],
                    model: getPieceModel(piece),
                };
            }
        });
    }

```

Deciding what should happen in the server and what in the client was a huge issue.
I thought it was going to take me less time to pass from a local playable prototype to a multiplayer server side game, but I was mistaken. It took some time.

Checking the game state winning condition between each move is difficult. There are several ways a game can end. 
We also have to take into consideration that we need to check for a win not when a round is over, but each time a piece has been moved.
There's even the specific case where a piece creates a bridge for each player.
<br />
```typescript

const checkGameOver = (gameState: ServerGameState): ServerGameState => {
  const updatedGameState = { ...gameState };

  // Check roads for both players
  const currentPlayerRoad = checkRoadWin(
    updatedGameState.tiles,
    updatedGameState.currentPlayer as PieceColor,
    updatedGameState.pieces
  );
  const otherPlayer = updatedGameState.currentPlayer === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
  const otherPlayerRoad = checkRoadWin(
    updatedGameState.tiles,
    otherPlayer,
    updatedGameState.pieces
  );

  // If the current player has a road, they win regardless of the other player's road
  if (currentPlayerRoad) {
    updatedGameState.winner = updatedGameState.currentPlayer;
    updatedGameState.gameOver = true;
    return updatedGameState;
  }

  // If only the other player has a road, they win
  if (otherPlayerRoad) {
    updatedGameState.winner = otherPlayer;
    updatedGameState.gameOver = true;
    return updatedGameState;
  }

  // Check empty tiles and selectable pieces
  const boardFull = isBoardFull(updatedGameState.tiles);
  const playerWithNoPieces = isAnyPlayerWithoutPieces(
    updatedGameState.pieces,
    updatedGameState.tiles
  );

  if (boardFull || playerWithNoPieces) {
    const whiteFlatstones = getFlatstones(
      updatedGameState.tiles,
      'white',
      updatedGameState.pieces
    );
    const blackFlatstones = getFlatstones(
      updatedGameState.tiles,
      'black',
      updatedGameState.pieces
    );

    // Win based on flatstones number
    if (whiteFlatstones > blackFlatstones) {
      updatedGameState.winner = 'white';
    } else if (whiteFlatstones < blackFlatstones) {
      updatedGameState.winner = 'black';
    } else {
      updatedGameState.winner = 'tie';
    }

    updatedGameState.gameOver = true;
  }

  return updatedGameState;
};
```

## Conclusion

<br />

When I started programming this project, I didn't know how to play the game. After trying it, I think it's a relaxing game with surprising depth.
